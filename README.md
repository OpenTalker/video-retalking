<div align="justify">  <BR> We present VideoReTalking, a new system to edit the faces of a real-world talking head video according to input audio, producing a high-quality and lip-syncing output video even with a different emotion. Our system disentangles this objective into three sequential tasks:
  
 <BR> (1) face video generation with a canonical expression
<BR> (2) audio-driven lip-sync and 
  <BR> (3) face enhancement for improving photo-realism. 
  
 <BR>  Given a talking-head video, we first modify the expression of each frame according to the same expression template using the expression editing network, resulting in a video with the canonical expression. This video, together with the given audio, is then fed into the lip-sync network to generate a lip-syncing video. Finally, we improve the photo-realism of the synthesized faces through an identity-aware face enhancement network and post-processing. We use learning-based approaches for all three steps and all our modules can be tackled in a sequential pipeline without any user intervention.</div>

## Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/vinthony/video-retalking.git
cd video-retalking
conda create -n video_retalking python=3.8
conda activate video_retalking

conda install ffmpeg

# Please follow the instructions from https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
# This installation command only works on CUDA 11.1
pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Inference

#### Pretrained Models
Please download our [pre-trained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18rhjMpxK8LVVxf7PI6XwOidt8Vouv_H0?usp=share_link) and put them in `./checkpoints`.

<!-- We also provide some [example videos and audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14OwbNGDCAMPPdY-l_xO1axpUjkPxI9Dv?usp=share_link). Please put them in `./examples`. -->

#### Inference

```
python3 inference.py \
  --face examples/face/1.mp4 \
  --audio examples/audio/1.wav \
  --outfile results/1_1.mp4
```
This script includes data preprocessing steps. You can test any talking face videos without manual alignment. But it is worth noting that DNet cannot handle extreme poses.

You can also control the expression by adding the following parameters:

```--exp_img```: Pre-defined expression template. The default is "neutral". You can choose "smile" or an image path.

```--up_face```: You can choose "surprise" or "angry" to modify the expression of upper face with [GANimation](https://github.com/donydchen/ganimation_replicate).
